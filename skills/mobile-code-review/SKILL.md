# Mobile code review

Review mobile code the way a senior Android, iOS and Flutter engineer would: find the defects that will crash,
leak, hang or mislead users in production, explain why each one matters, and show the fix.

## When to use

- A pull request, merge request, branch, commit range or single file needs review.
- The user asks "review this", "is this safe to merge", "what is wrong with this code".
- Before merging changes in Kotlin, Java, Swift, Objective-C interop or Dart code.
- After the agent itself wrote mobile code and should check it before handing it over.

Not for: a full security audit (use `mobile-security`), or designing an architecture from scratch
(use `mobile-mvvm`, `mobile-mvi`).

## Workflow

1. Establish scope.
   - Diff against the merge base, not the tip of main: `git diff --merge-base origin/main`.
   - Read the MR description and linked ticket so findings are judged against intent.
2. Identify platforms and load the matching reference before reviewing:
   [Kotlin](references/kotlin.md), [Java](references/java.md), [Swift](references/swift.md),
   [Dart and Flutter](references/dart.md).
3. Read every changed file in full, plus direct callers and callees of changed functions.
   A hunk out of context hides most lifecycle and threading bugs.
4. Pass over the change once per dimension, in this order:
   correctness, concurrency, lifecycle and memory, security and privacy, UI performance,
   architecture, error handling, tests, accessibility, i18n.
5. Verify each candidate finding before reporting it.
   - Trace the code path. Check it is not already handled elsewhere (base class, interceptor, wrapper).
   - If it cannot be confirmed from the code, report it as a question, not a defect.
6. Assign a severity (see below) and write a minimal fix snippet for every Blocker and Major.
7. Give the verdict. Do not edit files unless the user asks for fixes.

## Severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Merge impact |
|---|---|---|
| Blocker | Crash, data loss or corruption, security or privacy breach, broken build, store rejection | Must fix before merge |
| Major | Wrong behaviour on a realistic path, leak, race, ANR or hang, swallowed error, missing test for new logic, broken layer boundary | Fix before merge, or defer only with a ticket |
| Minor | Maintainability, small inefficiency, unclear naming that misleads, missing edge-case test | Should fix, may be a follow-up |
| Nit | Preference or polish. Never blocks | Optional |

Rules for severity:
- Rate by consequence and likelihood, not by how easy the fix is.
- Do not report what the formatter or linter already enforces.
- One root cause is one finding. List extra locations inside it.

## Rules

### 1. Coroutines and tasks are scoped to an owner and cancellable

Work outlives its screen when launched in a global scope. It leaks memory and writes to dead UI.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD
GlobalScope.launch { repo.sync() }

// GOOD
viewModelScope.launch { repo.sync() }
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: unstructured task keeps running after the view disappears
.onAppear { Task { await model.load() } }

// GOOD: cancelled automatically when the view disappears
.task { await model.load() }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD
_sub = stream.listen(_onData); // never cancelled

// GOOD
@override
void dispose() {
  _sub?.cancel();
  super.dispose();
}
```

Java:
```java
// BAD: executor never shut down, callbacks hit a destroyed Activity
executor.execute(() -> textView.setText(load()));

// GOOD: work in a ViewModel, result exposed as LiveData, executor shut down in onCleared()
executor.execute(() -> result.postValue(load()));
```

### 2. Cancellation is never swallowed

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: runCatching also catches CancellationException and breaks structured concurrency
val user = runCatching { api.user() }.getOrNull()

// GOOD
val user = try {
    api.user()
} catch (e: IOException) {
    null
}
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: loop ignores cancellation
for id in ids { await upload(id) }

// GOOD
for id in ids {
    try Task.checkCancellation()
    await upload(id)
}
```

### 3. UI state is touched only on the main thread or actor

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: hardcoded dispatcher, untestable and easy to misuse
withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { dao.insert(item) }

// GOOD: injected dispatcher
class Repo(private val io: CoroutineDispatcher) {
    suspend fun save(item: Item) = withContext(io) { dao.insert(item) }
}
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: UI state mutated from an arbitrary executor
final class FeedModel: ObservableObject { @Published var items: [Item] = [] }

// GOOD
@MainActor @Observable
final class FeedModel { var items: [Item] = [] }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD: 5 MB JSON parsed on the UI isolate, drops frames
final data = jsonDecode(body);

// GOOD
final data = await Isolate.run(() => jsonDecode(body));
```

### 4. No long-lived references to short-lived objects

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: Activity leaked for the lifetime of the process
object Analytics { lateinit var context: Context }

// GOOD
class Analytics @Inject constructor(@ApplicationContext private val context: Context)
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: self -> timer -> closure -> self
timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) { _ in self.tick() }

// GOOD
timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in self?.tick() }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD: controller created in build, never disposed
Widget build(BuildContext context) => TextField(controller: TextEditingController());

// GOOD: owned by the State object, disposed in dispose()
late final _controller = TextEditingController();
```

### 5. Async UI code re-checks lifecycle after every suspension point

Dart:
```dart
// BAD
await repo.save();
Navigator.of(context).pop();

// GOOD
await repo.save();
if (!context.mounted) return;
Navigator.of(context).pop();
```

Kotlin (Compose):
```kotlin
// BAD: collects while the app is in the background
val state by viewModel.state.collectAsState()

// GOOD
val state by viewModel.state.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
```

### 6. UI recomposes and rebuilds only what changed

Kotlin (Compose):
```kotlin
// BAD: no key, item state jumps on reorder
LazyColumn { items(messages) { MessageRow(it) } }

// GOOD
LazyColumn { items(messages, key = { it.id }) { MessageRow(it) } }
```

Swift (SwiftUI):
```swift
// BAD: index identity, wrong rows animate on insert
ForEach(items.indices, id: \.self) { i in Row(item: items[i]) }

// GOOD: Item is Identifiable with a stable id
ForEach(items) { item in Row(item: item) }
```

Dart (Flutter):
```dart
// BAD: whole screen rebuilds on every tick
setState(() => _seconds++);

// GOOD: only the label listens
ValueListenableBuilder<int>(
  valueListenable: _seconds,
  builder: (context, value, _) => Text('$value'),
)
```

### 7. Errors are handled where they can be acted on, and never silently dropped

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD
try { upload() } catch (e: Exception) { }

// GOOD
try {
    upload()
} catch (e: IOException) {
    _state.update { it.copy(error = UiError.Network) }
}
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD
let data = try? await api.fetch()

// GOOD
do {
    state = .loaded(try await api.fetch())
} catch {
    state = .failed(error)
}
```

### 8. Layer boundaries hold

- ViewModels and domain code do not import `android.view`, `UIKit` views or `BuildContext`.
- Domain models are not network DTOs or database entities. Map at the data-layer edge.
- UI does not call repositories or APIs directly.

```kotlin
// BAD: ViewModel holds a View and returns a Retrofit DTO
class ProfileViewModel(private val view: TextView, private val api: Api)

// GOOD
class ProfileViewModel(private val getProfile: GetProfileUseCase) : ViewModel()
```

### 9. New logic ships with tests, and tests are deterministic

```kotlin
// BAD: real delay, flaky and slow
Thread.sleep(500)

// GOOD: virtual time, runs instantly
@Test fun retriesAfterBackoff() = runTest {
    val repo = Repo(api = failingOnceApi, io = StandardTestDispatcher(testScheduler))
    val result = async { repo.load() }
    advanceTimeBy(500)
    assertEquals(expected, result.await())
}
```

Swift: use `await` on the operation under test, not `sleep`. Dart: use `fakeAsync` or `tester.pump(duration)`.

### 10. Accessibility and i18n are part of correctness

```kotlin
// BAD
Icon(Icons.Default.Delete, contentDescription = null) // actionable icon, no label

// GOOD
Icon(Icons.Default.Delete, contentDescription = stringResource(R.string.delete))
```

```swift
// BAD: concatenated String is shown verbatim, never localized, no plural rules
Text("You have " + String(count) + " messages")

// GOOD: localized key with a plural variation in the String Catalog
Text("You have \(count) messages", comment: "Inbox count")
```

- Touch targets at least 48dp (Android) or 44pt (iOS).
- Text scales with system font size. No fixed heights on text containers.
- Use start/end, not left/right, so RTL layouts work.
- Never build sentences by concatenating translated fragments.

## Anti-patterns

- Reviewing only the diff hunks without opening the full file.
- Reporting style issues the linter already catches.
- "Consider refactoring" with no reason and no snippet.
- Twenty Nits hiding one Blocker. Order by severity, cap Nits at five.
- Guessing at a bug the code does not show. Ask instead.
- Approving with an open Blocker or Major because "it was already like that". Pre-existing issues in
  touched lines are in scope; elsewhere, mention them once as out of scope.
- Rewriting the author's whole function in the fix snippet. Show the smallest change.

## Checklist

- [ ] Read the MR description, ticket and every changed file in full
- [ ] Coroutines, Tasks, Futures and Streams have an owner and are cancelled
- [ ] Cancellation is propagated (no catch-all over suspending or async code)
- [ ] UI state mutated only on main thread or `@MainActor`
- [ ] No Activity, Context, View or BuildContext stored beyond its lifecycle
- [ ] Closures capturing `self` checked for cycles; controllers and subscriptions disposed
- [ ] Lists have stable keys or identity; no heavy work in composition, body or build
- [ ] No swallowed errors; user-facing failure state exists
- [ ] No secrets, tokens or personal data in code or logs (escalate to `mobile-security`)
- [ ] Layer boundaries respected; DTOs mapped at the data layer
- [ ] New logic has deterministic tests
- [ ] Accessibility labels, touch targets, dynamic text size
- [ ] User-visible strings localized, plurals handled, RTL safe
- [ ] Every Blocker and Major has a fix snippet
