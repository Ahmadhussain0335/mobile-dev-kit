# Mobile performance

Find and fix the performance problems users actually feel: slow launch, dropped frames, hangs, memory
growth, large downloads and battery drain. The agent measures first on a release-like build on a real
low or mid-range device, changes one thing, measures again under the same conditions, and reports the
numbers, not impressions.

## When to use

- "The app is slow to start", "scrolling stutters", "the UI freezes", "memory keeps growing".
- Android vitals, the Xcode Organizer or MetricKit show slow starts, ANRs, hangs, hitches or high memory.
- The APK, AAB or IPA grew, or users complain about battery or mobile data use.
- Setting up Macrobenchmark, Baseline Profiles, XCTest performance tests or Flutter profiling.
- Reviewing a change that touches the startup path, a scrolling list, images, background work or sync.

Not for: general code review (use `mobile-code-review`), Compose, SwiftUI or widget API usage without a
measured problem (use `mobile-kotlin`, `mobile-swift`, `mobile-flutter`), BLE throughput and connection
tuning (use `mobile-ble`), or CI pipeline setup (use `mobile-ci-cd`).

## Workflow

1. Name the symptom and the one metric that captures it (see the table below). "Feels slow" is not a
   metric; "cold start TTID median 1 850 ms on a Galaxy A15" is.
2. Fix the test conditions before measuring, and keep them for the "after" run.
   - Build: release-like. Android `benchmark` build type (non-debuggable, `profileable`, R8 on). iOS
     Release configuration through Profile. Flutter `--profile`.
   - Device: a real low or mid-range phone your users own. Never an emulator or simulator for numbers.
   - State: charged above 50 %, not hot, other apps closed, same OS version, same network.
   - Details in [references/measuring.md](references/measuring.md).
3. Measure the baseline with enough runs to trust it (startup at least 10 iterations, frames over a
   scripted scroll of at least 5 runs). Record median and P90, not the best run.
4. Find the cause with a trace (Perfetto, Instruments, DevTools), not by reading code alone. Load the
   platform reference: [Android](references/android.md), [iOS](references/ios.md),
   [Flutter](references/flutter.md). Flutter apps also need the host tools for native startup.
5. Change one thing. Several changes at once make it impossible to tell which one helped or hurt.
6. Re-measure with the same build type, device, iterations and statistic. Keep the change only if the
   difference is larger than the run-to-run noise.
7. Lock the gain in: a benchmark or performance test in CI, and field monitoring (Android vitals,
   Organizer, MetricKit) to confirm it in production.
8. Report with the output format below. If a number could not be measured, say so; never estimate it.

## Metrics and thresholds

| Area | Lab metric | Field source | Reference values |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup (Android) | `timeToInitialDisplayMs`, `timeToFullDisplayMs` (`StartupTimingMetric`) | Android vitals | Vitals flags slow cold start at 5 s or more, warm 2 s or more, hot 1 s or more |
| Startup (iOS) | `XCTApplicationLaunchMetric`, App Launch template | Organizer Launch Time, `MXAppLaunchMetric` | Time to first frame after the launch screen; compare release over release |
| Startup (Flutter) | `--trace-startup` `timeToFirstFrameMicros` | Host platform vitals | Same as the host platform |
| Jank (Android) | `frameDurationCpuMs`, `frameOverrunMs` (`FrameTimingMetric`) | Vitals slow and frozen frames | Slow session: more than 50 % of frames over 16 ms. Frozen: more than 0.1 % over 700 ms |
| Jank (iOS) | `XCTOSSignpostMetric.scrollingAndDecelerationMetric`, Animation Hitches | Organizer hitch rate | Hitch rate at or below 10 ms/s is good. Main-thread work per frame under about 5 ms |
| Hangs | Main thread blocked | ANR rate, Organizer hangs, `MXHangDiagnostic` | ANR core vital 0.47 % overall, 8 % per phone model. iOS: delays over 100 ms are noticeable |
| Frames (Flutter) | UI and raster time per frame in DevTools | Host platform vitals | About 16 ms per frame at 60 Hz, 8 ms at 120 Hz |
| Memory | Heap and leaks in LeakCanary, Allocations, DevTools | Vitals memory metrics, `memoryMetrics` | No retained screens after navigating back |
| Battery | Wake locks, wakeups, background network | Vitals battery metrics, `cpuMetrics` | Vitals: background network over 50 MB per day, Wi-Fi scans over 4 per hour |
| Size | Download and install size per variant | Play Console, App Store Connect | Track every release; investigate any jump |

Thresholds change. Check the current Android vitals and Apple pages before quoting them to a team.

## Rules

### 1. Numbers come only from release-like builds on real devices

Debug builds run with JIT, assertions and debugger hooks. Their numbers are meaningless.

Kotlin (Gradle):
```kotlin
// BAD: benchmarking the debug variant on an emulator
// GOOD: release-like and debug-signed; add <profileable android:shell="true"/> to the manifest
create("benchmark") {
    initWith(getByName("release"))
    signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("debug")
    matchingFallbacks += listOf("release")
}
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: timing launch with print(Date()) in a Debug run from Xcode
// GOOD: XCTest performance test, Release configuration, physical device
func testLaunch() {
    measure(metrics: [XCTApplicationLaunchMetric()]) { XCUIApplication().launch() }
}
```

Dart:
```sh
flutter run            # BAD: debug, JIT, asserts
flutter run --profile  # GOOD: AOT, with tracing for DevTools
```

### 2. Android ships a Baseline Profile and a startup profile

Without one, a fresh install interprets and JIT-compiles the startup path. Google reports about 30 %
faster execution of covered code from the first launch.

```kotlin
// BAD: no profile, first launches after every update run cold code
// GOOD: generated by the Baseline Profile Gradle plugin (androidx.baselineprofile)
@get:Rule val rule = BaselineProfileRule()

@Test fun generate() = rule.collect(
    packageName = "com.example.app",
    includeInStartupProfile = true,
) {
    pressHome()
    startActivityAndWait()
}
```

- Profiles are installed only for release builds. Regenerate them when the startup path or main user
  journeys change. Full setup in [references/android.md](references/android.md).
- Flutter apps: the Dart code is already AOT-compiled; a profile helps only the Kotlin and Java side.

### 3. Nothing non-critical runs before the first frame

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: every SDK initialized on the main thread before any UI
class App : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Analytics.init(this); RemoteConfig.fetchBlocking(); Maps.init(this)
    }
}

// GOOD: only what the first screen needs; the rest is lazy or deferred
@HiltAndroidApp
class App : Application() {
    @Inject lateinit var analytics: Lazy<Analytics> // dagger.Lazy, created on first use
}
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: synchronous network and database work in didFinishLaunchingWithOptions or App.init
init() { try? database.migrateAndSyncNow() }
// GOOD: show cached content, refresh after the first frame
.task { await model.refreshInBackground() }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD: await analytics.init(); await remoteConfig.fetchAndActivate(); before runApp
// GOOD: await only what the first frame needs
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final settings = await Settings.load();
  runApp(App(settings: settings));
  unawaited(analytics.init());
}
```

- App Startup (`androidx.startup`) replaces many library content providers with one, and lets you turn
  off automatic initialization and call `AppInitializer` later. It does not make slow init fast by itself.
- iOS: fewer embedded dynamic frameworks, no `+load` or static initializers, and mergeable libraries
  (Xcode 15+) reduce pre-`main` time.

### 4. Report when the screen is really usable

TTID ends at the first frame, often a spinner. Mark the point where real content is shown.

Kotlin (Compose):
```kotlin
// BAD: no signal, TTFD is never reported
// GOOD
ReportDrawnWhen { state.items.isNotEmpty() }
```

Swift (iOS 16+):
```swift
// GOOD: extended launch counted in MetricKit until content is ready
let id = MXLaunchTaskID("load-feed")
try MXMetricManager.extendLaunchMeasurement(forTaskID: id) // main thread, before the first scene is active
await model.loadFeed()
try MXMetricManager.finishExtendedLaunchMeasurement(forTaskID: id)
```

Flutter: mark the moment with a `dart:developer` `Timeline` event for lab traces; field launch numbers
come from the host platform ([references/flutter.md](references/flutter.md)).

### 5. Frame work stays inside the frame budget

Parsing, sorting, image decoding and disk access belong off the main thread or UI isolate.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: 2 MB JSON parsed on the main thread during scroll
val items = json.decodeFromString<List<Item>>(body)
// GOOD
val items = withContext(defaultDispatcher) { json.decodeFromString<List<Item>>(body) }
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: Task inherits the main actor, the parse still blocks the UI
Button("Load") { Task { items = parse(data) } }
// GOOD: @concurrent (Swift 6.2) always leaves the caller's actor
@concurrent nonisolated func parse(_ data: Data) async -> [Item] { /* ... */ }
Button("Load") { Task { items = await parse(data) } }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD
final items = parseItems(body);
// GOOD
final items = await Isolate.run(() => parseItems(body));
```

### 6. Update only what changed

Compose, SwiftUI and Flutter all redo work for every reader of changed state. Narrow the readers.

Kotlin (Compose):
```kotlin
// BAD: reads scroll offset in composition, recomposes every pixel
Box(Modifier.offset(y = (scroll.value / 2).dp))
// GOOD: read in the layout phase, no recomposition
Box(Modifier.offset { IntOffset(0, scroll.value / 2) })
```

Swift (SwiftUI):
```swift
// BAD: ObservableObject, every @Published change re-evaluates every observing body
final class Feed: ObservableObject { @Published var items = [Item](); @Published var clock = Date() }
// GOOD: @Observable tracks only the properties each body reads
@Observable final class Feed { var items = [Item](); var clock = Date() }
```

Dart (Flutter):
```dart
// BAD: whole screen rebuilds when the counter changes
final state = context.watch<CartModel>();
// GOOD: only this widget rebuilds, and only when count changes
final count = context.select((CartModel c) => c.count);
```

More patterns: `mobile-kotlin` references/compose.md, `mobile-swift` references/swiftui.md,
`mobile-flutter` references/performance.md.

### 7. Images are decoded at display size

A 4000x3000 photo is about 48 MB of pixels, whatever size it is drawn at.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD
val bmp = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(path)
// GOOD: let the image loader size it to the view, or downsample yourself
AsyncImage(model = url, contentDescription = null, modifier = Modifier.size(48.dp)) // Coil
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD
let image = UIImage(contentsOfFile: path)
// GOOD: ImageIO thumbnail at the target pixel size (48 pt at 3x)
let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, nil)!
let options = [kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
               kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: 144] as CFDictionary
let thumb = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(source, 0, options)
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD
Image.file(file, width: 48);
// GOOD
Image.file(file, width: 48, cacheWidth: (48 * MediaQuery.devicePixelRatioOf(context)).round());
```

### 8. Leaks are found with a tool, then fixed at the reference

Navigate into and out of a screen five times. If its objects are still alive, something holds them.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: singleton keeps the listener, and through it the Activity
override fun onStart() { super.onStart(); DeviceHub.addListener(listener) }
// GOOD: paired registration
override fun onStop() { DeviceHub.removeListener(listener); super.onStop() }
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: infinite async loop keeps self alive forever
Task { for await value in stream { self.render(value) } }
// GOOD: owned by the view lifecycle, cancelled when it disappears
.task { for await value in model.stream { model.render(value) } }
```

Dart:
```dart
// BAD: controller never disposed, ticker and listeners leak
late final _controller = AnimationController(vsync: this, duration: _d);
// GOOD
@override
void dispose() { _controller.dispose(); super.dispose(); }
```

Tools: LeakCanary (debug builds only), Xcode Memory Graph and Instruments Leaks and Allocations
generations, DevTools Memory view Diff Snapshots.

### 9. Background work is batched, constrained and deferrable

Every wakeup and radio power-up costs battery. Let the OS schedule work when it is cheap.

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: own timer, wakes the device every minute on any network
handler.postDelayed(syncRunnable, 60_000)
// GOOD: one unique periodic job, unmetered network, battery not low
val request = PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder<SyncWorker>(6, TimeUnit.HOURS)
    .setConstraints(Constraints.Builder()
        .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.UNMETERED)
        .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)
        .build())
    .build()
WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .enqueueUniquePeriodicWork("sync", ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP, request)
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: large upload started on a default session over cellular
// GOOD: background session the system schedules, or a BGProcessingTask
let config = URLSessionConfiguration.background(withIdentifier: "com.example.upload")
config.isDiscretionary = true
let request = BGProcessingTaskRequest(identifier: "com.example.cleanup")
request.requiresExternalPower = true
request.requiresNetworkConnectivity = true
try BGTaskScheduler.shared.submit(request)
```

- iOS: `BGTaskScheduler` identifiers must be listed under `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` in
  Info.plist, with the Background Modes capability. Call out that Info.plist and capability change.
- Android 15+: `dataSync` and `mediaProcessing` foreground services are limited to 6 hours per 24 hours.
  Android 16 applies job runtime quotas by standby bucket, also to jobs started in the foreground.
- Test with Doze and standby forced (commands in [references/android.md](references/android.md)).

### 10. Network traffic is small, cached and not polled

Kotlin:
```kotlin
// BAD: no cache, the same 300 KB list downloaded on every screen open
val client = OkHttpClient()
// GOOD: HTTP cache honours Cache-Control and ETag from the server
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .cache(Cache(File(context.cacheDir, "http"), 20L * 1024 * 1024))
    .build()
```

Swift:
```swift
// BAD: prefetching on a default session over cellular and in Low Data Mode
// GOOD: discretionary traffic waits for a cheap network
config.allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess = false
config.allowsExpensiveNetworkAccess = false
config.waitsForConnectivity = true
```

- Paginate; request only the fields the screen shows; let the server compress responses.
- Replace polling with push (FCM, APNs) or with server-driven `Cache-Control` and conditional requests.
- Coalesce telemetry into batches. Device identifiers in payloads are personal data (see
  `mobile-eu-compliance`).

### 11. App size is measured per release and kept down

- Android: `isMinifyEnabled = true` and `isShrinkResources = true` in release (BAD: both off).
  Ship an AAB; inspect with APK Analyzer (Build > Analyze APK, Compare with previous APK).
- iOS: export with "All compatible device variants" and read `App Thinning Size Report.txt`;
  App Store Connect shows the real per-device sizes.
- Flutter: `flutter build appbundle --analyze-size` or `flutter build ios --analyze-size`, then the
  DevTools app size tool. `--split-debug-info` removes symbols from the binary; keep them for crashes.

### 12. Regressions are caught before users see them

- Run Macrobenchmark or XCTest performance tests on a fixed device in CI, nightly at least.
- iOS: set XCTest baselines per device; the test fails when a metric regresses past the baseline.
- Subscribe to MetricKit and watch Android vitals after each staged rollout step.
- Flutter: `flutter drive --profile` with `traceAction` gives a frame summary per run
  ([references/flutter.md](references/flutter.md)). MetricKit subscriber: [references/ios.md](references/ios.md).

## Anti-patterns

- Optimizing without a baseline number, or claiming an improvement without an "after" number.
- Measuring a debug build, an emulator, a simulator or a flagship phone only.
- Reporting the single best run. Use median and P90 over repeated runs.
- Changing several things, then crediting the one you expected to help.
- Adding `remember`, `@Stable`, `RepaintBoundary`, `const` or caching everywhere "for performance"
  without a trace showing the problem.
- Treating a splash screen as a startup fix. It hides TTID; it does not shorten it.
- Moving startup work to a background thread that the first screen then waits on.
- Keeping LeakCanary, StrictMode penalties or verbose tracing in release builds.
- Requesting a battery optimization exemption instead of using WorkManager, FCM or BGTaskScheduler.
- Polling a server every few seconds from the foreground or a foreground service.
- Comparing app sizes between a universal APK or IPA and a thinned or Play-delivered download.
